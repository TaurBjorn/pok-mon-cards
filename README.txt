--POKEMON CARD with HTML AND CSS FLEXBOX--

The Pok√©mon card has been built with CSS flexbox/HTML for educational purposes. 

This is an open-source project where I demonstrate my skills in HTML en CSS Flexbox.
Feel free to inspect and build one on your own.

Always open for feedback :)

Happy coding :)
