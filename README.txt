--POKEMON CARD with HTML AND CSS FLEXBOX--

The Pok√©mon card has been built with CSS flexbox/HTML for educational purposes. 

This is an open-source project where I demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS Flexbox.
Feel free to inspect and build one on your own.

Always open for feedback :)

Happy coding :)

I have no affinity with Nintendo, The Pokemon Company or Game Freak. This project is just made for educational purposes in what you can build with CSS.
